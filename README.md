## Digit Recognition using Neural Networks and TensorFlow
In this project I have created and trained a Neural Network model that can predict digits from hand-written images with a high degree of accuracy. I have used the popular MNIST dataset which has lots of images of hand-written digits along with their labels.

#### _This model gives a test set accuracy of 96.07%_

## Clustering of Geographical Data
In this project I have used Taxi rank data for the city of Johannesburg and the clustered data has been presented on a interactive **_MAP_**
#### _The Accuracy of the mode is determined by Silhouette Score which is 75%_
